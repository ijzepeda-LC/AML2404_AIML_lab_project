## Overview

Welcome to the **Kadabra** repository! We've developed an innovative system, a chatbot that goes beyond simple conversations. Kadabra is designed to interact with users through a Telegram interface, helping them identify movies of interest. Whether it's through providing a brief synopsis or even using an image from the movie script, Kadabra has you covered.

The system is rooted in two core components:
1. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
2. Facial Recognition

## Inspiration

The motivation behind **Kadabra** was the popular application Shazam, renowned for its music and song recognition capabilities. The name "Kadabra" serves as a playful nod to this renowned service. We often find ourselves in situations where we catch snippets of movies on public screens and wish we knew what they were. Furthermore, there are instances where we might forget a movie title or the actors in it but vividly remember the plot. **Kadabra** bridges this gap. Simply describe the plot, and our application will furnish the movie name you're trying to recall.

## Features

- **Telegram Interface**: Seamlessly interact with Kadabra on Telegram.
- **Synopsis Identification**: Describe a movie plot, and Kadabra will try to identify the movie.
- **Image-Based Search**: Provide an image from a movie script, and Kadabra uses facial recognition to identify the movie or actors.
